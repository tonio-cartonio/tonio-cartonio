I do block game software.

My main public project as of now has been fantabos-co, a ForgeHax continuation for 1.12.2 servers.
[![fantabos.co](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=fantabos-co&repo=fantabos.co)](https://github.com/fantabos-co/fantabos.co)

I worked on a proxy and helped on small projects.

I maintain fantabos.co cloud infrastructure and services.

I sometimes play on oldfrog.org.
