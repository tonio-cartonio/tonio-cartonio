I do block game software.

My main public project as of now has been fantabos-co, a ForgeHax continuation for 1.12.2 servers.
<div class="github-card" data-github="fantabos-co/fantabos.co" data-width="400" data-height="" data-theme="default"></div>
<script src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/github-cards/latest/widget.js"></script>

I worked on a proxy and helped on small projects.

I maintain fantabos.co cloud infrastructure and services.

I sometimes play on oldfrog.org.
